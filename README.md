# pokedex-app

This is a basic app initially built with vanilla JavaScript that fetches data from the Pokdex API, displays it, and uses modals to display more details of each individual item including an image.
The navigation bar and the modal were built with Bootstrap. The layout is responsive.

The app is published on gh-pages: https://sarahjd.github.io/pokedex-app/.
