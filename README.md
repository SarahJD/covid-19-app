# pokedex-app

This is a basic app initially built with vanilla JavaScript that fetches data from the
<a href="https://pokeapi.co/">Pok√©API</a>, displays it, and uses modals to display more details
of each individual item including an image. The navigation bar and the modal were built with
Bootstrap. The layout is responsive.

The app is published on gh-pages: https://sarahjd.github.io/pokedex-app/.
